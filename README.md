### Citi Bike Rider Pie Charts for Two Major Rider Types

From the pie charts we can see that there is an overwheling amount of total riders that are members of the program and they prefer classic bikes with electric bikes being a distant second choice. No data was gathered on the actual inventory type of bikes at each station but assumptions can be made that there are more classic bikes, possibly due to their cost effectiveness and rentability.

### Final Analysis

With all the data gathered we can see that the regular rider is a member who uses a classic bike and is often traveling around 8 AM and 5 PM possibly going to and from work or school. October is also shown as the highest usage month in Q4 with December tapering off troughout the month possibly due to the weather or the holiday season.
